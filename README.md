### Code

After performing feature enginerring and feature selection (to find out which will contribute and have good relation with target variableI) on data set, we trained our model to predict price by Using Random Forest. To serialize our python code we used pickle module. Pickel moduel Is used to convert python object into a byte stream. You can Read more about pickle Module [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html#:~:text=%E2%80%9CPickling%E2%80%9D%20is%20the%20process%20whereby,back%20into%20an%20object%20hierarchy.).
